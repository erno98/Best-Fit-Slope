# Best-Fit-Slope
Program calculating the best fit slope for given data set. It also consists of a function generating a random set, with correlation or disassociation of data.

The code consists also of the function to plot the given data set, along with the best fit line, with the coefficient of determination printed as the title of the plot.

It is easy to notice, that the code is familiar to one of the popular Python tutors on youtube, sentdex. I heavily encourage to check out his contents, as his channel is main source of my Machine Learning and Python knowledge.
